# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Using classification models to predict customer churn - supervised learning.

Project Aim: Analyse all relevant customer data and predict customer retention behaviour that can help develop customer retention programs.

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

Size: 7043 instances, 21 features

Classification model packages: DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier

Workflow: Data Cleaning - Explorative Data Analysis - Data Preprocessing (label encoding) - Model Training - Model Evaluation



The data set includes information about the following:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
